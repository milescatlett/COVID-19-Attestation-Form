# COVID-19-Attestation-Form
The lead nurse for our district requested a form that would display the results of the COVID-19 attestation (Have you had a fever? Have you been around anyone with COVID? etc...) on a screen to bypass asking the list of questions to students as they enter the building.

The script works by triggering when the registration form is submitted. This trigger creates a new form specific to the family with the names of all children and their respective schools. Each time the parent takes children to school, they fill out the form, and it send an email with the attestation. "No" responses appear in green. "Yes" Responses appear in red. The date and name of the children also appear. This can be shown in the car rider line instead of having to answer attestation questons.
